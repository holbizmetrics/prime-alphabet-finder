## 1. Collatz Sequences

| Prime | Sequence Length | Maximum Value |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| 23    | 16              | 160           |

**Key finding:** 31 has an exceptionally long Collatz sequence (107 steps) compared to 23 and 29.

## 2. Continued Fractions

Ratios between triplet members:
- 29/23 = [1, 3, 1, 5]
- 31/23 = [1, 2, 1, 7]
- 83/23 = [3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4]

## 3. Sum of Squares (Fermat's Theorem)

| Prime | mod 4 | Sum of 2 Squares |
|-------|-------|------------------|
| 23    | 3     | Impossible       |
| 29    | 1     | **2² + 5² = 29** |
| 31    | 3     | Impossible       |
| 83    | 3     | Impossible       |

**Discovery:** Only 29 can be expressed as sum of two squares.

## 4. Euler Totient φ(n)

- φ(23) = 22
- φ(29) = 28
- φ(31) = **30 = primorial(3)** ← Matches index sum!
- φ(83) = 82

---

## 5. Sum of Divisors σ(n)

- σ(23) = 24 = **4!**
- σ(29) = 30 = **primorial(3)**
- σ(31) = 32 = **2⁵**
- σ(83) = 84

**Pattern:** Each σ value has a special form!

---

## 6. Primitive Roots

- Smallest primitive root mod 23: **5**
- Smallest primitive root mod 29: **2**
- Smallest primitive root mod 31: **3**

**Cross-check:** 31 mod 29 = 2 is a primitive root of 29!

---

## 7. Lucas Numbers

Lucas sequence: 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, **29**, 47, 76, 123...

**Discovery:** 29 = L(7) is a Lucas number!

---

## 8. Pythagorean Triples

- 23: leg in (23, 264, 265)
- **29: HYPOTENUSE in (20, 21, 29)** ← Consecutive legs!
- 31: leg in (31, 480, 481)
- 83: No Pythagorean triples

**Major discovery:** 29 is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with consecutive integer legs (20, 21)!

## 9. Pi and e Digit Positions

| Prime | Position in π | Position in e |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| 23    | **16**        | **16**        |
| 29    | 186           | 131           |
| 31    | 137           | 189           |
| 83    | 26            | Not in first 200 |

**Discovery:** 23 appears at position 16 in BOTH π and e!

---

## 10. Chemical Elements

| Z  | Symbol | Element   | Note |
|----|--------|-----------|------|
| 23 | V      | Vanadium  | Named for Norse goddess |
| 29 | Cu     | Copper    | Coinage metal |
| 31 | Ga     | Gallium   | Melts in hand |
| 83 | Bi     | Bismuth   | Heaviest stable element |

All four are metals. Bismuth (83) is the heaviest element with a stable isotope.

## 11. ASCII Values

- ASCII 23 = ETB (End of Transmission Block)
- ASCII 29 = GS (Group Separator)
- ASCII 31 = US (Unit Separator)
- ASCII 83 = **'S'** (for Sum!)

---

## 12. Musical Ratios

- 29/23 ≈ 1.261 (close to major third 5/4 = 1.25)
- 31/23 ≈ 1.348 (close to perfect fourth 4/3 ≈ 1.333)

The triplet approximates harmonic intervals!

---

## 13. Base-60 (Sexagesimal)

- 23₆₀ = 23
- 29₆₀ = 29
- 31₆₀ = 31
- **83₆₀ = 1:23** ← Contains 23!

**Discovery:** In Babylonian base-60, 83 = 1:23, embedding 23 within it!

---

## 14. Prime Gap Records

The gap of 6 after prime 23 (to reach 29) is a **record-setting gap** - the first time a gap of 6 appears in the prime sequence.

---

## 15. Arithmetic Progressions

While (23, 29, 31) is NOT an AP (gaps 6, 2), the primes (17, 23, 29) form an AP with common difference 6.

23 sits at the center of the AP (17, 23, 29).

## 16. Legendre Symbols (Quadratic Residues)

|      | mod 23 | mod 29 | mod 31 | mod 83 |
|------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 23   | --     | 1      | -1     | 1      |
| 29   | 1      | --     | -1     | 1      |
| 31   | 1      | -1     | --     | 1      |
| 83   | -1     | 1      | -1     | --     |
